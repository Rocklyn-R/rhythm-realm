# 🎸 Rhythm Realm

**Rhythm Realm** is a full-stack e-commerce demo application built for portfolio purposes. It simulates an online store for musical instruments, allowing users to browse products, log in, manage a wishlist and cart, and simulate a checkout experience. This project showcases my ability to design and build a complete PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) application.
